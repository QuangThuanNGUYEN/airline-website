            <hr class="hr123">
            <div class="his">SkyWays Airlines was founded in 1995 by a group of aviation professionals and travel enthusiasts who shared a single mission: to connect remote and regional communities across Australia with safe, affordable, and efficient air travel. What started as a modest operation with just two turboprop aircraft serving the Northern Territory quickly grew into a trusted name in the skies. Within three years, SkyWays expanded its fleet, launched routes to 25+ destinations, and introduced eco-friendly initiatives such as carbon-offset flights and fuel-efficient scheduling. Today, we are proud to carry thousands of passengers every month, offering a seamless experience that blends technology, comfort, and genuine Aussie hospitality. Whether you're flying for work, family, or adventure — SkyWays is here to take you there</div>
